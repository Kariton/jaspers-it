# Codebase for my personal website [jaspers.it](https://jaspers.it)

This [Hugo](https://hugo.io/) website is based on the [Perplex theme](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex),  
created by JÃ¶rg (Georg) Makowski and available under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/bowman2001/perplex/blob/main/LICENSE).

As of now, I use a slightly customized version of this theme, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Kariton/perplex/tree/jaspers-it).

This website is currently hosted on [Hetzner Webhosting](https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting).
