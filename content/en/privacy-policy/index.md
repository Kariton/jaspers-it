No data is collected, stored, or analyzed beyond web server logs.

## General

Personal data is the new oil.
Since I also want to protect your data, I carefully and conscientiously select all components used to operate this site.

Nevertheless, I rely on the data protection practices of the providers of various services to protect your data.
Only services that claim to comply with the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu) are used.

For maximum transparency, I have detailed which services I use and how they handle the data collected.

## Information Collection

I do not collect, store, or analyze cookies or personalized information from you.

## Hosting Provider

This website is hosted on [Hetzner Webhosting](https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting).

### Hosting Provider Privacy Policy

#### Hetzner Webhosting

> For our customers' websites, the log files store, among other things, the IP address, the browser visitors use, the time and date of the visits, and the system that visitors use. We at Hetzner Online only store pseudonymised IP addresses of visitors to the website. At the web server level, this happens by default by storing an IP address `<123.123.123.XXX>` in the log file instead of the visitor's actual IP address, for example, `<123.123.123.123>`. The XXX is a random value between 1 and 254, so it is no longer possible to establish the true identity of the visitor.
> --- [Hetzner Data Privacy FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/general/general-terms-and-conditions/data-privacy-faq/)

I have disabled the preservation of web server logs for Hetzner Webhosting. Nevertheless, I still have access to [Live Logs](https://docs.hetzner.com/konsoleh/account-management/statistics/live-logs) where IP addresses are anonymized, as stated above, to ensure your privacy.
Purely for debugging purposes, I might review the web server logs provided by the hosting provider.

## Analytics

I use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters) to understand how people find my website. These services provide me with insights but do not share personal data about you.

Information that I receive through these services includes, but is not limited to:

- Most common search queries that led to my site
- Most frequently visited pages
- Country of origin
- Type of device
- Links from other sites to my pages

This is an industry-standard practice and only works for users accessing this site through Google or Bing search results.

Other types of access, such as direct visits or links from other websites, are not affected.
