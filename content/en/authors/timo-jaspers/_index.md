Computer Science Expert Subject Area: System Integration
{.p-first}

Here, I share insights into my home lab tinkering as well as
various aspects of my professional life.

Additionally, I write about anything else that interests me,
such as my ants, my cat, or other experiences and projects.

Since I bought my first gaming PC in 2016, I have been engaged in homelabbing.
It all started with virtualized game servers in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), port forwarding, and regularly scripted backups of game save files.

A year later, I bought my first home server and migrated from [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) to [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview).
With an eye on security risks on the **W**orld **W**ide **W**est, I began virtualizing
a firewall, implementing VLANs, and delving deep into IT administration.

Initially, I focused on learning the fundamentals of Linux, IT infrastructure, and infrastructure management in my homelab.

Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for IT and system administration, which ultimately led me to leave my job as an industrial mechanic and pursue a career as an IT specialist for system integration.

Today, I work as a system integrator and experiment with various software deployments, load balancing and high availability, infrastructure designs, and a wide variety of technologies in my homelab to set up and maintain infrastructure and applications.

As an open-source enthusiast, I am passionate about the collaborative nature of open-source projects and hope that the current corporate greed does not undermine the economy and the spirit of free and open-source software.
